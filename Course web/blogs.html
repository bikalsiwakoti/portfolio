                    <p>While some forms of technology may have made positive changes in the world, there is evidence for the negative effects of technology and its overuse, as well. 
                        Social media and mobile devices may lead to psychological and physical issues, such as eyestrain and difficulty focusing on 
                        important tasks. They may also contribute to more serious health conditions, such as depression. The overuse of technology may have 
                        a more significant impact on developing children and teenagers.In this article, learn about the psychological and physical health
                         effects of technology, as well as how to create healthful habits with technology and avoid overuse.<span id="dot">.........

                     <span id="morepara">
                     <h2>Psychological effects</h2>
                     <h4>Isolation</h4>
                     <p>Technologies, such as social media, are designed to bring people together, yet they may have the opposite effect in some cases.Finding ways to reduce
                          social media use, such as setting time limits for social apps, may help reduce feelings of isolation in some people.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Depression and anxiety</h4>
                    <p>Their research found mixed results. People who had more positive interactions and social support on these platforms appeared to have lower levels of depression and anxiety.
                         However, the reverse was also true. People who perceived that they had more negative social interactions online and who were more prone to social
                          comparison experienced higher levels of depression and anxiety. So, while there does appear to be a link between social media and mental 
                        health, a significant determining factor is the types of interactions people feel they are having on these platforms.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Physical health effects</h2>
                    <h4>Eyestrain</h4>
                    <p>Technologies, such as handheld tablets, smartphones, and computers, can hold a person’s attention for long periods. This may lead to eyestrain. 
                        Symptoms of digital eyestrain can include blurred vision and dry eyes. Eyestrain may also lead to pains in other areas of the body, such as the head, neck, or shoulders. 
                        Several technological factors may lead to eyestrain, such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Screen time</li>
                        <li>Screen glare</li>
                        <li>Screen brightness</li>
                        <li>Viewing too close or too far away</li>
                        <li>Poor sitting posture</li>
                        <li>Underlying vision issues</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Poor posture</h4>
                    <p>The way many people use mobile devices and computers may also contribute to incorrect posture. Over time, this may lead to musculoskeletal issues.
                         Many technologies promote a “down and forward” user position, meaning the person is hunched forward and looking down at the screen. This can put an
                          unnecessary amount of pressure on the neck and spine. A 5-year study in the journal Applied Ergonomics found an association between 
                          texting on a mobile phone and neck or upper back pain in young adults.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Sleep problems</h4>
                    <p>Using technology too close to bedtime may cause issues with sleep. This effect has to do with the fact that blue light, such as the light from cell phones, e-readers, and computers, stimulates the brain. 
                        Authors of a 2014 study found that this blue light is enough to disturb the body’s natural circadian rhythm. This disturbance could make it harder to fall asleep or lead to a person feeling less alert the next day.
                         To avoid the potential impact of blue light on the brain, people can stop using electronic devices that emit blue light in the hour or two before bedtime.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>The recent boom in technology has changed the average American lifestyle. While technology has many positive effects, there are some possible risks.
                         Anyone uncertain about the effects that technology has on them may want to take steps to cut back on their use of devices and screen time and re-evaluate how they feel with and without these devices.
