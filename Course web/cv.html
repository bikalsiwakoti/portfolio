                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am Bikal Siwakoti ! I am a student of Itahari International College (IIC) located in western part of Nepal. 
                        It is one of the best IT college of Nepal which is affiliated with London Metropolitian University. I have elder brother 
                        and i am a youger son of my family. My hobby is coding and video editing, i love to do coding and video editing. 
                        When i was a child, about 10 years ago my family buy laptop for me which helps me to continue my hobby from the past. I have lot of
                        experieces of computuing things and quite more familiar with programming and webdeveloping. I passed my school from Tender feet
                        boarding school located between Dulari and Itahari. I finished my +2 high school from Koshi saint james college which is located 
                        in Itahari. Beacuse i have finish my school from Tender feet boarding school i have got lots of friends near Dulari and because of
                        the best IT college near me, I decided to join Itahari International College. And yeah i love doing research on everything, I believe 
                        that 90% of our problem can easily solved by just doing reserch which increase our knowledge and skills which is very benificial for future just like i was researching
                        webdeveloping around 3 year past and it becomes more easier for me in the younger age.
